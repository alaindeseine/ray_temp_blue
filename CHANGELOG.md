## 1.0.0+stable

### Stable Release - Production Ready

* **Connection Status Monitoring**
  * Real-time connection status stream via `connectionStatusStream`
  * Automatic connection loss detection and recovery
  * Visual connection status indicators in example app

* **Automatic Reconnection (HOLD Mode)**
  * Automatic reconnection every 10 seconds when connection is lost
  * MAC address-based reconnection for faster pairing
  * Smart reconnection only when device was previously connected

* **Enhanced Connection Methods**
  * `scanAndConnectFirst()` - Scan and connect to first device found
  * `connectByMacAddress(String macAddress)` - Direct connection by MAC address
  * Improved connection reliability and error handling

* **Example App Improvements**
  * Integrated mode selector with connection status display
  * Real-time Bluetooth connection indicator (green/red)
  * Automatic reconnection status messages
  * Enhanced user experience with visual feedback

* **Bug Fixes**
  * Fixed HOLD mode implementation - no longer activates sensor notifications
  * Resolved overflow issues in example app with scrollable interface
  * Improved error handling and user feedback

* **Dependencies Updated**
  * flutter_blue_plus: ^1.35.5 (was ^1.32.12)
  * permission_handler: ^12.0.1 (was ^11.3.1)

### Breaking Changes
* HOLD mode now works correctly by reading sensor manually instead of using notifications
* Connection status monitoring requires listening to `connectionStatusStream`
